# Android Native Sample Apps

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of **native Android applications** developed using **Kotlin and Java** as part of my learning and hands-on practice in Android development. Each app focuses on a specific core concept of Android, ranging from basic UI interactions to intents, Jetpack Compose, and simple application logic.

These projects are designed to demonstrate my understanding of Android fundamentals and my ability to build functional native Android applications.
